First eventlistener is the like button
Second eventlistener is the comments
Added a third eventlistener (title name turns red when clicked)

Hey Dan, I got the likes to work on each car, the comments work on each car, also grabbed the car name from the API to change the name of each car. Since the API is under the Honda only make, the 6 cars are all Honda. I couldn't find a way to have the Honda as lower case because the API has them as lower case. I really am fine with them being capital, cause its working honestly. 

The only thing left to do, if you can change each image to correspond to the new car's name. Then we're done
