//JS issues I'm running into. Since each car's HTML is the same, I've run into the issues on applying the JS code to each car. 
The first car's like button as well as the comments/reviews input is functioning, but I'm having difficulty getting the other cars to do the same. I changed car #2 (Subaru) button id and changed it to id="like-button-two" and created another event listener to grab that car and have its likes and comments work. 
Right now, the subaru is compeltely set as default because once you select post (to post a comment) the page refreshes. I'm not getting errors in the DOM so I'm a little stuck. 
I also had to change the image source in the HTML. It was under ./assests and then the car name, but we have the ./assests right now so it wouldn't pull the image. You're more than welcome to change anything you need.
